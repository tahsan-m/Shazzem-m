              In addition to the blog’s clever title that is a play on the phrase “a cup of joe”, the title’s design is also unique. The letter O of the word “of” in “A Cup of Jo” is hollowed out to reveal a picture that changes depending on which page of the blog you’re on.
              
              The homepage also features a list of the most popular blog posts of the month – an excellent way to promote the blog to new readers by providing them easy access to the blog’s best content of the month.</p>
